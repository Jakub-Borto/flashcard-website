# flashcard-website
Polish-English flashcard website
Because of no user autenthication for this website, I can only give the source code of this project. Me and my peers still use it for our education so I can't share the link. I will make an account system in the future as a learning opportunity. If you're a recruiter from a university, feel free to contact me, so I can give you my login personally. Enjoy!

How does it work?
You select the user and then the group of flashcards that you want to learn
Flashcard pops up, you can see the translation after clicking a button
Then you rate how hard it was from 1 to 4 (0 deletes the flashcard)
Flashcards are randomized but when one is selected then it has a chance to pop up depending on what user selected
1 - 12,5% (1/8)
2 - 25% (2/8)
3 - 75% (6/8)
4 - 100% (8/8)
